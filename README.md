In this project, I developed and deployed a fully functional web application using modern DevOps and cloud technologies. The project involved creating a simple web application with a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and a backend using Node.js (Express). Both components were containerized using Docker to ensure consistent and portable deployment.

The application was deployed on AWS, utilizing EC2 instances for hosting. Additionally, I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying the application. 

Key achievements include successfully deploying Dockerized frontend and backend services on AWS, setting up robust CI/CD automation, and documenting the entire process with detailed instructions and deployment logs. This project provided hands-on experience with Docker, AWS services, and CI/CD workflows, equipping me with essential skills for modern software development and DevOps practices.
